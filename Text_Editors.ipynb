    "# Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "Text editors are an integral part of data analysis. There are many different flavors: some have a graphical interface, some are on the command line; some are good for writing papers, others for code. As you begin to conduct more analyses you will see that some tools suit you better than others. With that said, we will introduce you to some of the text editors that we use often and recommend."

    "\n",
    "vim is one of the most basic, ligthweight, and widely available and used text editors around. It is bundled with almost all unix environments. It is convenient for working remotely where you do not have a keyboard and mouse, which graphical editors require. Instead, you use commands and the arrow keys to navigate the file. Sounds intimidating but it's pretty straightforward!"
